## Thread.ofVirtual vs Kotlin Coroutine Comparison

| Aspect                  | `Thread.ofVirtual`                                               | `Kotlin Coroutine`                                             |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Overhead**            | More efficient compared to native threads, but there is overhead in managing virtual threads | Generally has lower overhead than conventional threads, as coroutines can share threads and perform cooperative multitasking |
| **Scalability**         | Designed to enhance scalability in applications with many light-weight tasks | High scalability as coroutines can share threads, minimizing the need for new threads |
| **Ease of Use**         | Simplifies thread management but still requires an understanding of thread pooling and resource management | Easier to use as it provides a higher-level abstraction, making the code more declarative and improving code clarity |
| **Platform Availability**| Depends on the platform and support from the JVM, may not be available in all environments | Platform-agnostic, can be used in various environments including JVM, Android, and JavaScript |
| **Code Complexity**     | Allows for cleaner and simpler code compared to native threads, but still requires manual management | Enables writing more concise and understandable code, reducing callback hell and improving code structure |

This table provides a general overview, and the best decision can vary depending on project requirements and developer preferences. Before choosing a concurrency mechanism, it is advisable to conduct performance testing in specific use cases to gain a better understanding of their performance in your application context.

## Execution Time Comparison: Kotlin Coroutine vs Thread.ofVirtual Java

Test results are relative depending on the environment you use. Incidentally, I use an Intel Core i5 machine with 16 GB RAM, Linux OS (Arch Btw).
If you use a different environment than me, the results will likely be different.

| Task               | Lang   | Approach              | Execution Time |
|--------------------|--------|-----------------------|-----------------|
| Write File         | Kotlin | Coroutine            | 33 ms           |
| Write File         | Java   | Thread.ofVirtual()   | 9 ms            |
| Data Processing    | Kotlin | Coroutine            | 32 ms           |
| Data Processing    | Java   | Thread.ofVirtual()   | 1 ms            |
| Http Request       | Kotlin | Coroutine            | 1114 ms         |
| Http Request       | Java   | Thread.ofVirtual()   | 603 ms          |


The table shows the execution time for various tasks in milliseconds. As observed, the times may vary significantly between Kotlin and Java for different operations.
